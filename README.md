An Ansible role that manages the client portion of SSH (keys, config, etc) on Debian/Ubuntu.


This role is useful for:

* Addding/removing ssh keys
* Distributing keys between hosts
* Setting up authorized_keys, .ssh/config, known_hosts

This role works best in conjuntion with a role designed to secure ssh servers. I recommend
[dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening](https://github.com/dev-sec/ansible-ssh-hardening).



Readme and tests coming soon.
<!-- 
## Installation

```
ansible-galaxy install linconf.nvm
```

## Example Playbooks

**Add a Self-Signed Certificate**

```
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - linconf.openssl
  vars:
    openssl_add_cert:
      - path: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}/myservice'
        crt_name: '{{ ansible_hostname }}.myservice.pem'
        key_name: '{{ ansible_hostname }}.myservice.key'
        common_name: 'myservice.com'
```

**Renew a Self-Signed Certificate**

Note: The expired certificate is backed up to `certname.pem.{ current-date }`. Manual intervention
would be required if you attempted to renew more than once per day.

```
- hosts: localhost
  roles:
    - linconf.openssl
  vars:
    openssl_add_cert:
      - path: '{{ ansible_fqdn }}/myservice'
        crt_name: '{{ ansible_hostname }}.myservice.pem'
        key_name: '{{ ansible_hostname }}.myservice.key'
        common_name: 'myservice.com'
        renew: True
```

**Optional: ssl-cert-check**

This role can optionally install [ssl-cert-check](https://github.com/Matty9191/ssl-cert-check) to 
notify you when certificates near expiration.

```
openssl_check_cert: True
openssl_check_cert_email: 'you@example.com'
``` -->

<!-- 
**Additional Options**

This role supports many more configuraiton options and actions.

See the [linconf.openssl documentation](http://linconf.com/ansible-openssl/) for a full list of available options.

`.kitchen` declaration. Instructions for performing test-kitchen runs locally
are detailed in the [LinConf Documentation](http://linconf.com/about/methodology/).
